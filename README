This repository contains code for converting between RADIANCE rgbe and
xyze HDR image formats and TIFF and JPEG files.  The programs are
support routines for the deva-filter workflow.  Somewhat similar
functionality is provided by the RADIANCE ra_tiff program.

The software can be built on either Linux or MacOS.  No Windows version
currently exits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

To make a displayable version of a RADIANCE HDR file, try:

    rad2jpeg --autoadjust input.hdr output.jpg

If you need to make exposure adjustment, try:

    rad2jpeg --autoadjust --exposure=+1  input.hdr output.jpg
			or
    rad2jpeg --autoadjust --exposure=-1  input.hdr output.jpg

Increase or decrease the exposure adjustment as needed.
