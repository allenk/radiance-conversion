   repository.  (Other versions of libjpeg may work as well.)

2. Run the following commands from the top level of the
   visualize-geometry directory tree:

     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     cd ..

     Copy the executable file "build/visualize-geometry" to wherever you
     want it.

To build the software for MacOS:

1. Install the package CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>

   Download and unpack Unix/Linux source from
   <http://www.cmake.org/download/>.

   In directory where source has been unpacked:

   ./bootstrap
   make
   sudo make install

2. Install the package libtiff <http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/>
   (this URL changes periodically!)

   Download and unpack the latest stable release of libtiff from
   <ftp://download.osgeo.org/libtiff/tiff-4.0.7.zip>.

   In directory where source has been unpacked:

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install 

3. Install the package libjpeg from <http://www.ijg.org/> or another
   source of your choosing. (A long term format war is underway between

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install 

4. Install the package libexif from
